##### -- From Bissau, to Palau; in the shade of Avalon

Good morrow, stranger! I am Ernaut and or Rorian; you may choose which name to call me. This repository is mainly meant for Pony Town; as I frequent there often. If you wish to interact, simply wander around the area nearest to the pond near the bakery; and or the area nearest to the library. I am professionally diagnoses with Autism, and Anti-Social Personality disorder, these will affect how I interact with you in-game. Hark! I'm quite friendly with people, though I don't necessarily like strangers approaching me. Please don't take this as offense!! You can always sign my guestbook if you wish to interact!!

##### -- From Fiji, to Tyree, and the Isles of Ebony

Disclaimer! I am a recovering IRL, and I wish to not interact with anyone else who identifies as an IRL. Also, please do not interact with me if any of these (https://dni-criteria.carrd.co) apply to you; Genshin Impact, and Honkai Star Rail fans/players are on thin ice. Other than that, I am fine with others approaching/interacting with me.
