Ernaut, present. I am the being behind this. I am autistic, and I have sociopathic tendencies; ergo, this may or may not affect how I communicate/interact with thee.

To put it simply, I have often have cannibalistic urges. Frequently I voice out these urges to close friends, usually by way of word, or jests. If you dislike this in any way, shape or form, be cautious when talking to me.

I, Ernaut, am usually seen near the library, caf√© or wandering around. I watch others have their conversations, or I have my own conversations; it is usually the former.

please do interact; unless I am with a friend. That is all, I bid thee farewell.
