Ernaut, present. I am the being behind this. I am autistic, and I have sociopathic tendencies; ergo, this may or may not affect how I communicate/interact with thee.

To put it simply, I have often have cannibalistic urges. Frequently I voice out these urges to close friends, usually by way of word, or jests. If you dislike this in any way, shape or form, be cautious when talking to me.

I, Ernaut, am usually seen near the library, caf√© or wandering around. I watch others have their conversations, or I have my own conversations; it is usually the former.

Before you interact, I wish that these, ![link](https://dni-criteria.carrd.co), dont apply to you. I mean this is the vilest way possible.
Secondly, I don't keep entities friended for long; I find myself unfriending most people I interact with, leaving off only one to two people. Apologies in advance.
I am BEGGING you to use tone tags, I am horrid at determining the tone of the conversation through text and in reality. If you wish for me to understand you, I suggest you use tone tags; /j, /hj, and /srs will suffice.

##### -- a more perfect union.
