##### -- From Bissau, to Palau; in the shade of Avalon

Good morrow, stranger! I am Ernaut and or Rorian; you may choose which name to call me. This repository is mainly meant for Pony Town; as I frequent there often. If you wish to interact, simply wander around the area nearest to the pond near the bakery; and or the area nearest to the library. Hark! I'm quite friendly with people, though I don't necessarily like strangers approaching me. Please don't take this as offense!! You can always sign my guestbook if you wish to interact!!
